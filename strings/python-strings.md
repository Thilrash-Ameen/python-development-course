# Python Strings

## Strings

*Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.*
 example - 'hello' or "hello"

## Assign String to a Variable

*Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:*

## Multiline Strings

*We can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes*

## Strings are Arrays

*Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.*
