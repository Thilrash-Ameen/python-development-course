# Variables

## Variables Names

*A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables*

    - A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    - A variable name cannot start with a number
    - A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    - Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

## Multi Words Variable Names

*Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read. There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable*

### Camel Case

*Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter*

### Pascal Case

*Each word starts with a capital letter*

### Sanke Case

*Each word is separated by an underscore character*
