# Variables

## Variables Names

*A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables*

    - A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    - A variable name cannot start with a number
    - A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    - Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

## Multi Words Variable Names

*Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read. There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable*

### Camel Case

*Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter*

### Pascal Case

*Each word starts with a capital letter*

### Sanke Case

*Each word is separated by an underscore character*

## Global Variables

*Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.*
*Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.*

*If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.*

### The Global Keyword

*Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function. To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.*
